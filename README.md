🌱 AgroPatrol Robot – AI/ML Based Smart Farm Surveillance System
AgroPatrol Robot is an intelligent farm surveillance system designed to protect agricultural land from animal intrusions using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The robot autonomously patrols farmland and uses an ESP32-CAM module to capture real-time images and video streams.
Using trained AI/ML models, the system detects and classifies different types of animals entering the farm area. Once an animal is identified, the data is processed in real time and stored in a database. Through a web-based application, instant alerts are sent to the farmer, providing details about the detected animal and enabling quick action to prevent crop damage.
This project aims to reduce human effort, minimize crop losses, and introduce smart technology into traditional farming practices—especially suitable for regions like Sri Lanka where wildlife intrusion is a major challenge.
