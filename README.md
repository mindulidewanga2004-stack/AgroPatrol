🤖 AgroPatrol Robot – Autonomous Farm Patrolling Robot
AgroPatrol Robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to patrol farmland and assist in protecting crops from animal intrusions. The robot is built to navigate agricultural environments while carrying onboard sensors and a camera module for continuous monitoring.
The system is powered by a microcontroller and motor driver setup that enables controlled movement across the field. A camera mounted on the robot captures real-time visuals, which are transmitted to a monitoring system for further processing and decision-making. The robot follows predefined patrol paths and operates with minimal human intervention.
This project focuses on the mechanical design, motor control, navigation, and embedded system integration required to build a reliable agricultural patrolling robot. It serves as a foundation that can be extended with intelligent features such as computer vision and automation.
